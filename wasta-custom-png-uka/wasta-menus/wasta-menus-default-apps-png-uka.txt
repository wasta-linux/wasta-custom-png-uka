# wasta-custom-png-uka: wasta-menus-default-apps-png-uka.txt
#
# This file should contain all the default wasta-menus apps for wasta-Linux
#   PNG Uka users.
#
# 'update-alternatives' is used to define which version of this file is
#   being used, so that regional customizations can override the default list
#   installed by the wasta-menus package.
#
# Any blank line or a line beginning with a '#' will be ignored.  Also, if an
#   application is not installed, it does not hurt to have it defined here.  For
#   example, it is OK to have an "Adapt It" specification here even if Adapt It
#   is not installed.  Later if Adapt It is installed, it will show in wasta-menus.
